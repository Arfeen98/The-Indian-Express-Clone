# End Notes ðŸ“‘
In this project I have tried to  clone  the original website as much as possible. This entire journey of this Unit construct week has given me 
experiences and I have learned lots of things about REACT, REDUX by applying to the real website and it gave me a lot more confidence in the REACT framework and especially in REDUX Most of the features are added and functionality of the website are achieved.

# Limitations
Pages are not responsive yet and all the pages are not dynamic also, those pages might not be properly visible on small screen devices as i was given only 6 days to clone the website and due to the News Api my website cant be deploy because this api only allow us to work in local host.
